🕵️ Detailed Event Analysis
🔻 2020: COVID-19 Shock

March 13, 2020
Bitcoin crashed alongside global equities during the pandemic’s onset. Massive liquidations in derivatives markets caused BTC to dip below $4K intraday before recovering.
➡️ Interpretation: BTC acted like a risk asset, not a safe haven.

🚀 Late 2020 – Early 2021: Bull Run

Dec 17, 2020 — BTC broke past its 2017 all-time high (~$20K). Institutional demand from firms like MicroStrategy drove bullish sentiment.

Jan 6–28, 2021 — Multiple anomalies reflect volatility during rapid climbs. Every sharp correction was quickly followed by rebounds, showing strong demand.
➡️ Interpretation: Institutional adoption + halving effects created a strong bull cycle.

💥 Feb 2021: Tesla Effect

Feb 8, 2021 — Tesla revealed a $1.5B BTC purchase and acceptance of BTC payments. Price surged nearly 20% in a single day.

Feb 23, 2021 — A correction followed as traders took profit near ~$50K.
➡️ Interpretation: Market highly reactive to corporate adoption news.

⚠️ Apr–May 2021: Crash Phase

Apr 18, 2021 — BTC began showing exhaustion signs after peaking ~$64K.

May 12–23, 2021 — A series of anomalies capture the largest BTC crash since 2017:

May 19, 2021 had the largest volume spike (126B USD), as cascading liquidations triggered panic.

Prices swung wildly with daily changes of ±10–14%.
➡️ Interpretation: The May crash was retail-driven panic amplified by leveraged liquidations.

❄️ 2022: Crypto Winter

Nov 8–10, 2022 — Anomalies coincide with the FTX collapse.

Nov 8–9 saw double-digit negative returns as contagion fears spread.

Nov 10 saw a temporary +10% rebound (short squeeze).
➡️ Interpretation: Structural risks (exchange insolvencies) fueled prolonged bearish sentiment.

📈 Key Insights

18 anomaly days reflect crisis events or major adoption news.

Largest Volume Spike: May 19, 2021 (126B USD) → Bitcoin’s biggest single-day washout.

Most anomalies occurred in bull run (2020–21) and FTX collapse (2022) periods.

Bitcoin consistently shows higher volatility during external shocks (COVID, FTX) and news-driven adoption events (Tesla, institutional buys).
